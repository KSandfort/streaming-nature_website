        The current state of digitalization resulted in the placement of
        thousands of wildlife cameras and webcams globally. These devices stream
        captivating video and audio content, offering a window into the diverse
        and vibrant nature of wildlife. On different platforms such as
        Explore.org, viewers can be fascinated by the live scenes of brown bears
        hunting for salmon, elephants congregating at a watering hole, or birds
        tenderly caring for their young. Yet, a significant challenge is
        prominent: live streams frequently lack any sort of activity to the
        dismay of the viewers. This research project addresses this challenge by
        proposing the development of an innovative artificial intelligence (AI)
        based technology, aimed at personalizing wildlife streaming. The
        objective is to create an engaging wildlife stream by observing and
        analyzing multiple streams. They will be merged into a seamless feed,
        customized to a user's specific preferences. Achieving this goal implies
        using existing AI models or developing new ones. These models are
        designed to accurately detect and interpret actions in live streams.
        They play a crucial role in determining which stream best suits the
        user's interests at any given moment. The research project aims not only
        for the development of personalized streaming technology using
        artificial intelligence but also for the creation of a user-friendly
        website. It serves to achieve a better user experience by allowing you
        to actively engage in the browsing experience and customize the
        settings.
